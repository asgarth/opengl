### Flock & Particle Engine
Two demo showing different effects in OpenGL.

Particle Engine demo show a simple implementation of a random generated particle engine. You can rotate and zoom with arrow keys and pause the demo with SPACE. For detail read the readme file contained in the zip archive.

Flock demo implement a set of objects (flock) that follow mouse pointer over the screen. If you want to know more about flocks you can read [this](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1987/SIGGRAPH87.pdf) article.

### CodeX
A screen saver that display text in a Matrix style using lines in its source code.

### Rain
A space shooter platform where enemy are generated at random during the game.

### RollBall
RollBall is a classic game where a ball rotate over a plane controlled with mouse. Move the mouse to take the ball at the end of each level.

### Genesis
Genesis is an application that create a 3DWorld from a map file and show a lot of Graphic Effect with OpenGL.
